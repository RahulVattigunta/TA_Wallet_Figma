# TA_Wallet_Figma

Project Overview

The TA Wallet App is a UPI-based digital payments application used in India. While functionally reliable, the legacy version suffered from an outdated UI, a lengthy login flow, and poor discoverability of core features. These issues introduced friction in time-sensitive payment scenarios.

This project represents a complete UX and UI redesign of the TA Wallet App, with a strong emphasis on speed, usability, accessibility, and security. The goal was to enable users to complete secure transactions within seconds while maintaining trust and compliance with modern UX standards.

The redesign was driven by user research, task-flow optimization, and modern front-end design principles, resulting in a cleaner, faster, and more intuitive digital payment experience.
